if u wanna create account cards etc u first need to set up a customer id or login so u get token

admin page
-- correct deposit money (Sql some trigger based issue i assume)
-- notification when a clinet is unable to pay his dues a particular month for emi
-- make admin secure...2 step authentication only verified users can access (2 step auth with email id)

loans
-- for loans add an emi system where automatically money deducted from client (when applying loan set a emi option in the combo box if it is selected... calculate emi (in another file as middleware) monthly payments and if users current account balance is less than that show a warning) (this will help u work with dates in JS cuz monthly deductions )
-- notification sent when money deducted(emi payment) or received(when loan approved).....along side this give reason for transaction
-- on client side create a loan status page which shows previous loans pending or approved
-- restructure by adding loan approval status, date, paid amount
-- user must not be able to choose interest rate
-- set limit to number of loan applications a person can send
-- error if no savings account

transactions 
-- notification when money deducted (notif comes on home page).....along side this give reason for transaction

accounts
-- automatically an account is created on creating a customer which requires auto increment (auto creation with trigger)
