I created a file called setup.js to hold all the basic setup code for our Node.js servers. This file sets up things like connecting to the database and configuring the server. 
Then, in each of our other files where we want to run a server, we simply import the app and pool from setup.js.
Also, to make it easier to manage multiple servers, we use a tool called PM2, which lets us start, stop, and manage all our servers at once using a simple command.



Use PM2 to Manage Servers:

Install PM2 globally (npm install -g pm2).

i have used ports from 8080 to 8084 (inclusive)...sharing compute between servers is called load balancing
